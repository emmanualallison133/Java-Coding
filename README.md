# Java-Coding-Assignments
This is a compilation of all the Java code I have made or was assigned to add my own code to.
All of these projects were made in NetBeans, so it is best to download and import the .zip files into NetBeans to see and test them.

The .java files for the programs are in the src folder of each downloaded .zip file, so even if you use another IDE, the programs should work so long as each of the required .java programs are in the same folder.
